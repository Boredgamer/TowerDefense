1.01
BGM
-Metroid prologue BGM now properly functioning as a .wav file over .mp3
-Prologue BGM stops before Invasion BGM starts

Turrets
-Racial turrets now have 1 attack power, to prevent infinite cc chains
-Racial turrets now have a cap of 10 placed turrets
-Racial shop tooltip displays number of placed racial turrets, as well as the cap
-Added possible upgrade ideas for Bomb and Racial turrets

Shop
-Sell and Undo now properly account for inflation (returned gold now scales with cost to buy -- turrets placed)

Map Generation
-Bottom right corner of blue side no longer extends past the drawn hitbox (which was preventing turret placement)

General
-Swapped "static" modifiers for "final" (except Main), because apparently I got that wrong initially
